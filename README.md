# Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development Reading Notes

## Readings 01 : Introduction to React and Components

### Component-based Architecture
  - Focuses on decomposing designs of individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing; methods, events, and properties.

  - Higher level of Abstraction
  - Divides problems into sub-problems. (paired with component partitions.)

#### Primary Objective of component-based architecture
  - Ensure component reusability.
    - Encapsulates functionality and behaviors of software elements into a reusable and self deployable binary unit.

### Advantages
  - Reduce time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
  - Increased Reliability with the reuse of the existing component

### What is a Component?
  1. A modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
  2. A software object, intended to interafcft with other components, ecapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities.
  3. A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only.

### Component Views
    - Object Oriented View
    - Conventional View
    - Process Related View

#### Object Oriented View
