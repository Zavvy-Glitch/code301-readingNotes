## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

### Notes cited from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding/)

1.What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
    - The growth in which computers started to become available to the homes of the general US population.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    - Early personal computers weren't anything more than toys, these toys were specifically marketed towards males. This became the narrative of an ideology of something that would, should, shall be "masculine" in nature. It wasn't just the manufacturers of these devices that sold the ideology, it was also that of the movie industry. This matters because it strictly creates an environment and expectation that only men/boys/males were the ones that would know how to use the technology.

## Why Diversity Matters in Tech

### Notes cited from [USAToday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
         - Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts. 

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
         - Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.” And in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. Research also links gender representation at the executive and board level with better company performance.  

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
         - Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.
         - By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table. 
         - When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
