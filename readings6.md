### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness

- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  - I have found that learning from other students and social skills to be the most beneficial. This is because at times, when trying to learn something new, it is easier to have someone to run things through with. The saying two minds are better than one isn't just a phrase it's the truth. When minds work collectively, you tend to find errors and answers more quickly. As for the social benefit, we're human. Yet, we're still a bit 'animalistic'. Sometimes we take a brand new environment to be a danger. Fight or flight response, rihgt? Majority of us would rather flee. Being part of a social group allows easier assimilation into a more formal/personal relationship.

- How does pair programming work?
  - 'Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.'
