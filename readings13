### Notes cited from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding/)

1.What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
    - The growth in which computers started to become available to the homes of the general US population.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
    - Early personal computers weren't anything more than toys, these toys were specifically marketed towards males. This became the narrative of an ideology of something that would, should, shall be "masculine" in nature. It wasn't just the manufacturers of these devices that sold the ideology, it was also that of the movie industry. This matters because it strictly creates an environment and expectation that only men/boys/males were the ones that would know how to use the technology.
